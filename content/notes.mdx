```

    String accessFiles = "You'll only be able to access"
        + "slides/notes with your uOttawa email.";
    String noAccessFiles = "You wont be able to use other email" 
        + "addresses to access slides... \nSorry";
    boolean uOttawaEmailOnly = true;

    if (uOttawaEmailOnly) {
        System.out.println(accessFiles);
    } else {

    }
```
