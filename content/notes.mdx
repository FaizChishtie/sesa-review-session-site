# FAQ

### Can you post links to old finals or midterms?

```python
    posting_exams = False
    message = "I will never be posting any past exams here!"
    request = "Please do not open any issue tickets asking me to post them."

    if not posting_exams:
        print(message, request)
```

### Can I access the slides with my personal email?

```java
    String accessFiles = "You'll only be able to access"
        + "slides/notes with your uOttawa email.";
    String noAccessFiles = "You wont be able to use other email" 
        + "addresses to access slides... \nSorry";
    boolean uOttawaEmailOnly = true;

    if (uOttawaEmailOnly) {
        System.out.println(accessFiles);
    } else {
        System.out.println(noAccessFiles);
    }
```

### Where do I navigate to to find my class?

```c++
    const char* note_locations = "Get your slides and notes from the pages on the left."
    std::cout << note_locations << std::endl;
```

### My class is not on the site - can you add it?

```javascript
    const URL='https://github.com/FaizChishtie/sesa-review-session-site/issues/new/choose'
    let newClassAddable = true;

    if ( newClassAddable ) {
        console.log( 'Of course we can! Provided we have the time/ the class is requested enough.'
            + '\nNavigate to: ' + URL
         );
    }
```
