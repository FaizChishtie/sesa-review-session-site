Here you'll find some examples for big:

```
    // big O  
     _____
    /  _  \
    | / \ |
    | \_/ |
    \_____/
```

# Some Functions

Evaluate the runtime of these functions!

## Examples of O(1)

```python
def func(n):
    return n*n

def func(n):
    for i in range(5000000000000):
        print(n)

def func(n):
    i = 50000000000000000
    while i > 10:
        print('wow this is going to run for a long time')
        print('it\'s still O(1) though!')
```

## An example of O(n)

Notice that there's a loop that's dependent on n!

```python
def func(n):
	s = 0
	for i in range(n): #in range n! 
		s += i
	return s
```

## An example of O(n^2)

Notice that the loops are nested in this case. Meaning that we get `n*n - or n^2 (:<` iterations.

```python
def func(n):
	s = 0
	for i in range(n):
		for j in range(n): #two range functions dependent on n
			s += j
	return s
```

## An example of O(logn)

Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array.

```python
def binary_search(alist, start, end, key):
    """Search key in alist[start... end - 1]."""
    if not start < end:
        return -1
    mid = (start + end)//2
    if alist[mid] < key:
        return binary_search(alist, mid + 1, end, key)
    elif alist[mid] > key:
        return binary_search(alist, start, mid, key)
    else:
        return mid
```

### Proof of O(logn) runtime:

Let `N` be the number of items in our list.

Let `x` be the number of times we need to halve our list to get to our queried item.

Let `lg(a)` be the log with base 2 of the number a.

------------------

`1/2^x` is our factor that we 'divide' `N` by to get our 1 item.


Therefore `1 = N/2^x`
          
`2^x = N`
          
`lg(2^x) = lg(N)`
          
`xlg(2) = lg(N)`
          
`x = lg(N)`

So the number of times we need to halve our list is `lg(N)`

Hence the runtime for binary search is `O(log(n))`

## Fun with recursive functions

We need to trace these functions to determine their bigOh value.

### Fibonacci Sequence

Fibonacci sequence written recursively.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if(n <= 1):
        return n
    else:
        return(fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2))
```

### Factorial

We should trace this recursive function to 

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```
