# About Inheritance

Inheritance allows programmers to define child classes that **inherit** _(sorry there's going to be a lot of this, 
I really dont know any other words to use in this case)_ methods and attributes from parent classes.

### An easy (but somewhat innacurate) way to think about inheritance

You should define a child class `C` and a parent class `P` only if by your definitions of the classes: `C` **IS A** `P`.



## Inheritance

```

    C1
    |
    |
    V
    C2

```

> `C2` inherits all of `C1`'s methods and properties!

`C1` is `C2`'s parent class! That means an object `C2` **is a** `C1`.

Just like a `Tesla` is a `Car`.

```python
class Base:
    pass

class Derived(Base):
    pass
```

## Multilevel Inheritance

```

    C1
    |
    V
    C2
    |
    V
    C3

```

> `C2` inherits all of `C1`'s methods and properties, `C3` inherits all of `C2`'s properties.

`C1` is `C2`'s parent class and `C2` is `C3`'s parent class. 

That means an object `C3` **is a** `C2`, and `C2` **is a** `C1`.

So _inherently_ `C3` **is a** `C1`

Just like a `ModelS` is a `Tesla` and `Tesla` is a `Car`.

```python
class Base:
    pass

class Derived(Base):
    pass

class EvenMoreDerived(Derived):
    pass
```

## Multiple Inheritance

> _Having started programming in Java I don't know why you'd use this but anyways_

```

    C1      C2
    |       |
    ----|----
        V
       C3

```

> `C3` inherits all of `C1` and `C2`'s methods and properties.

`C1` and `C2`'s are parent classes for `C3`.

That means an object `C3` **is a** `C1`, and `C3` **is a** `C2` but `C1` **is not** a `C2`.

Just like a `Student` is an `Engineer` and a `Student` is a `Musician`.

Where `Engineer` is not necessarily a `Musician`.

```python
class Base1:
    pass

class Base2:
    pass

class Derived(Base1, Base2):
    pass
```

## super() and other cool things

Use `super()` in your child classes to call parent classes!

If you don't want to repeat functionality in your code you should use super.

```python
class Base:
    def __init__(self, things):
        pass

    def method(self, arg)


class Derived(Base):
    def __init__(self, things, extra_things):
        super().__init__(things) # calls parent class to handle 'stuff' attribute assignment
        self.extra_things = extra_things # implement new attribute handled by 'Derived'

    def method(self, arg):
        super().method(arg)    # This does the same thing as:
                               # super(Derived, self).method(arg)
```

### Method Resolution Order (mro)

Calling `super()` from a child class will search through parent classes to find the method you're calling.

For example, if `D` inherits from `B` inherits from `C` inherits from A you call `super()` in B, then super() searches `C` -> `A`.


## Here we'll take a look at some inheritance examples!

Our classes:

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def move(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        
    def overrideMe(self):
        print('I have not been overriden')
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Car {}, {}'.format(self.x, self.y)
    
    def honk(self):
        print('beep')

class Tesla(Car):
    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0, z=0 ):
        super().__init__(x, y)
        self.z = z
    
    def charge(self):
        print('Charging tesla!')
        
    def overrideMe(self):
        print('I have been overriden')
        
    def __repr__(self):
        return '{}, {}'.format(super().__repr__(), self.z)
        
    def move(self, x, y, z):
        super().move(x,y)
        self.z = z
        
```

Try:

```
some_car = Car()
some_tesla = Tesla()

some_tesla.charge()

some_tesla.move(3,4, 5)

print(some_car, some_tesla)

some_car.overrideMe()
some_tesla.overrideMe()

some_car.honk()
some_tesla.honk()
```
