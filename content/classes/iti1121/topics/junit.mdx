# JUnit

JUnit related topics will be covered here.

## Installation

Files:

* [junit-4.13.jar](https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=junit/junit/4.13/junit-4.13.jar)
* [hamcrest-1.3.jar](search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/hamcrest/hamcrest-all/1.3/hamcrest-all-1.3.jar)

> I'd suggest downloading these into wherever your java folder is.

### Editing Path/Environment Variables

[Java's way of editing path/env variables](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml)

** Windows **

Go to: 

`Setings> Edit the system environment variables > Environment variables > System variables > CLASSPATH`

Add two entries which point to the locations of your files!

i.e. `C:\Somepath\junit-4.13.jar`

> Note: Replace Somepath with your file locations

** Mac/Linux/Unix **

You're going to have to edit the commands based on where your files are located.

I'd suggest pasting the commands into a text document and modifying them before entering them in the command line.

> Either run this in your terminal each new session:

```
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:Wherever your files are/junit-4.13/junit-4.13.jar:Wherever your files are/junit-4.13/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:.
```

> Or navigate to .bash_profile and write this:

```

cd ~

cat .bash_profile

echo export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:Wherever your files are/junit-4.13/junit-4.13.jar:Wherever your files are/junit-4.13/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:. >> .bash_profile

```

> If you can't find .bash_profile:

Make sure you're in the right directory (i.e. `cd ~`)
    
    
_Try writing `l` - You should see this:_

```

fchishtie@MyComputerName ~ l                                                                                                                                                                                  ✔  2148  15:04:11
    total 1112

    ...

    -rw-------    1 fchishtie  staff   7.1K  5 Mar  2019 .bash_history
    -rw-r--r--    1 fchishtie  staff   593B  2 Apr  2019 .bash_profile

    ...

```

_If you want to be cool & faster you can also write `l | grep .bash_profile` but don't worry about this too much._

If you don't see that - try writing `cd ~` again & retry the commands above!
