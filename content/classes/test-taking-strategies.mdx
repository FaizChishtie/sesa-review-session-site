# ITI1120

Beware, python is an easy language - the tests for this class are by no means as simple.

## Multiple Choice

It is imperative that you **READ QUESTIONS AND THE CODE CAREFULLY**.

These multiple choice questions are not really like others. They're tricky, and will not usually be obvious - if they are, be suspicious.

Read the code and relate it to what the question is asking (i.e. print/return).

## Memory Models

Use these to trace the execution of the program! _(Especially useful with recursion/loops))_

## Time Management

Some questions in these evaluations will be much harder than others, it may be obvious, but hit the questions you know how to solve before trying to tackle these questions.

A simple metric for knowing how much time you should be spending on a question is: 

```python
def get_total_marks(number_of_questions, marks):
    return number_of_questions * marks

def get_minute_per_mark(total_exam_minutes, total_marks):
    metric = total_exam_minutes/total_marks
    return "You should spend " + metric + " minutes/mark"
```

### Example: 

Each exam question is 2 marks, there are 30 questions, and you have 60 minutes for the exam

```python
>>> total_marks = get_total_marks(30, 2)
>>> print(get_minute_per_mark(60, total_marks))
"You should spend 1 minutes/mark"
```

So if a question is 8 marks, plan to spend 8 minutes on it (or less)

# General

For programming classes (or any that are applicable), follow these steps:

* Recognize _(What the question is asking you)_
* Plan _(How you'll address the problem)_
* Do _(Implement your solution)_

Sometimes doing this may be overkill - so don't really waste your time using this method on questions that are **objectively** obvious.

This technique can be used to validate your answers on your final look through.
